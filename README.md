By this snippet of code you can understand the flow of a Convolutional Neural Network model and how to make use of it.
The data which i have used is about the classification model for Dogs and Cats. You can replace the data by creating such dataset by your own and integrate it with the code.
For integration, provide the directory path of you data from you local disk, provided the data should be splitted and created as folders before uploading it to the code.
